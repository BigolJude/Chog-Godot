# Chog!

Chog is intended as a configurable language learning game. The main gameplay is intended to put the main character "Chog" into different workplace situations. 

## Development / Mechanics

Chog is written almost entirely in C# using the game engine Godot (Dot net) version.

The main mechanic is the games language system. All dialog within the game is written in xml files and is easily configurable.
As the games development progresses more languages may appear but Lithuanian is the only intended available language for now.
